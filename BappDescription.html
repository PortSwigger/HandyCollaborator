Handy Collaborator is a Burp Suite Extension that lets you use the
Collaborator tool during manual testing. It is possible to generate a
Collaborator payload from the contextual menu of editable tabs (Repeater,
Intercept, etc.) and a separate thread will check periodically all
interactions (DNS, HTTP and SMTP) received by the Collaborator for the
generated payloads. If an interaction is found, an issue with all the
details is added to the target host.
