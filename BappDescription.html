<p>Handy Collaborator is a Burp Suite Extension that lets you use the
Collaborator tool during manual testing in a comfortable way. It is
possible to generate a Collaborator payload from the contextual menu of
editable tabs (Repeater, Intercept, etc.) and a separate thread will check
periodically all interactions (DNS, HTTP and SMTP) received by the
Collaborator for the generated payloads. If an interaction is found, an
issue with all the details is added to the target host.</p>

<p>With the new version it is possible to enable/disable polling. This is
useful when testing an application on a private network with no Internet
connection. Polling can be re-enabled at a later time when an Internet
connection becomes available, to check for past interactions.</p>
